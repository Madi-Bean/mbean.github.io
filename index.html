	<h1>My First Pet: Rocket</h1>

	<p>Rocket is my first pet. I got her in the winter of 2020, right before lockdown. She is turning four years old this year.</p>

	<p> Rocket is a black <strong>Holland Lop</strong>, which means she has long floppy ears.</p>

	<p> Rocket's diet consists of mostly hay, but her favourite treats include cucumber and banana. </p>
